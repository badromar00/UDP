# UDP Server and Client

This is a simple server and client UDP project in Python.

## Files
- `udp_server.py`: The UDP server that listens for messages and responds with a joke.
- `udp_client.py`: The UDP client that sends a message to the server and prints the response.

## How to Run

1. **Start the Server**
   
   Open a terminal and run:
   
   ```bash
   python udp_server.py
   ```

2. **Run the Client**
   
   Open another terminal and run:
   
   ```bash
   python udp_client.py
   ```

You should see the client send a message and receive a humorous response from the server.
